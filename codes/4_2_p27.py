#   Purpose    : Implement code that takes an input as 64-bit integer and swaps the bits at indices i and j.
#   Background : A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index 0
#                corresponding to the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit at index 63
#                corresponding to the most significant bit (MSB).
#                e.g., the 8-bit integer 73 can be viewed as array of bits, with the LSB being at index 0.
#                 0  1   0   0   1   0   0   1
#                MSB                        LSB
#
#   Instruction
#               1. import 4_2_p27
#               2. Run the function 4_2_p27.start()
#               3. The results will be generated in the console
