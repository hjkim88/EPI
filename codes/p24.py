#   Purpose    : How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64-bit words?
#   Background : The parity of a binary word is 1 if the number of 1s in the word is odd;
#                otherwise, it is 0. For example, the parity of 1011 is 1, and the parity of 10001000 is 0.
#                Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication.
#                It is fairly straightforward to write code that computes the parity of a single 64-bit word.
#
#   Instruction
#               1. import p24
#               2. Run the function p24.start()
#               3. The results will be generated in the console
